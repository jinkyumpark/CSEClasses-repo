# 1 - Introduction
## SW Engineering: All aspects of SW product from development to maintance
why? SW crisis: Big, Many, Long
## Typical Activity of SW Engineering
1. SW Specification -> SRS
2. SW Development -> SDS
3. SW Validation -> V&V
4. SW Evolution -> SE

# 2 - SW Process
## SW Process: a structured set of activities required to devleop a SW
1. RS
2. D&I
3. V&V
4. SE/M
## SW Process Model
- Waterfall: Plan-deriven
- Interactive: Agile, planning incremental
  - XP
  - TDD
  - PP
- Integration & Configuration(CBD(Component Based Development)

## Waterfall
1. Requirement Definition - SRS
2. System and SW Design - SDS
3. Implementation and Unit Testing - Coding
4. Integration and System Testing - IT
5. Operation and Maintenance

## Incremental Development

## Integration and Configuration(CBD)
