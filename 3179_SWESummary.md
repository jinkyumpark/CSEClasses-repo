# 1 - Introduction
- Def, SW Engineering: All aspects of SW product from development to maintance
why? SW crisis: Big, Many, Long
- Typical Activity of SW Engineering
1. SW Specification -> SRS
2. SW Development -> SDS
3. SW Validation -> V&V
4. SW Evolution -> SE

- Def, SW Process: a structured set of activities required to devleop a SW
1. RS
2. D&I
3. V&V
4. SE/M
- Def, SW Process Model
1. Waterfall: Plan-deriven
2. Interactive: Agile, planning incremental
