# 1 - Introduction
## SW Engineering: All aspects of SW product from development to maintance
why? SW crisis: Big, Many, Long
## Typical Activity of SW Engineering
1. SW Specification -> SRS
2. SW Development -> SDS
3. SW Validation -> V&V
4. SW Evolution -> SE

# 2 - SW Process
## SW Process: a structured set of activities required to devleop a SW
1. RS
2. D&I
3. V&V
4. SE/M
## SW Process Model
- Waterfall: Plan-deriven
- Interactive: Agile, planning incremental
  - XP
  - TDD
  - PP
- Integration & Configuration(CBD(Component Based Development)

## Waterfall
1. Requirement Definition - SRS
2. System and SW Design - SDS
3. Implementation and Unit Testing - Coding
4. Integration and System Testing - IT
5. Operation and Maintenance

## Incremental Development
1. Outline Description
2. Waterfall
  - Specification
  - Development
  - Validation
- Pros
  - No Interdependent Component
  - Developed Independent with Each Other
- Cons
  - The Process is not Visible
  - Documentations are not easy
  - Degrade
  
## Integration and Configuration(CBD)
1. SW Reuse: COTS(Commercial-off-the-shelf)
2. Configuration
- Pros
  - Reduced Costs and Risks(not developed from scratch)
  - Faster Delivert
- Cons
  - Requirement Compromises
  - Loss of Control over Evolution

## Overview of SW Process
### Requirement Engineering -> Requirement Documents
1. Requirement Elicitation and Analysis
  - System Description
2. Requirement Specification
  - User and System Requirements
3. Requirement Validation
3. Requirements Documents
### SW Evolution
1. Define System Requirements
2. Assess Existing Systems
3. Develop System Change
4. Modify Systems
5. New System

### CMMi(Capability Maturity Model Integrated)
1. Initial - Aware
2. Repeatable - Trying
3. Defined - Perfect
4. Managed - SW Process + SPI(Quality Management)
5. Optimizing

# 3 - Agile
## Agile Overview
### Motivation
1. Reduce Overhead
2. Respond Quickly to Changing Requirement

### Method
1. Code > Design
2. Based on Interactive Approach
3. Deliver SW quickly, evolve quickly

### Manifests
1. Individuals and Interaction over Process and Tools
2. Working SW over Comprehensive Documentation
3. Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
4. Responding to Change over Following a Plan

### Principles
1. Customer Involvement
2. Incremental Delivery
3. People not Process
4. Embrace Change
5. Maintain Simplicity

### Procedures
1. Select User Stories
2. Break down the task
3. Plan release

## XP(Extreme Programming)
- New versions several times a day
- Increments to customer every 2 weeks
- TFD(Test First Development)

### XP Practices
- Incremental Planning
- Small releases
- TFD, TDD
- Refactoring
- Pair Programming
- Collective Owenership
- Continuous Integration(CI)
- Sustainable Pace
- On-site Customer

### XP Principles
- Incremental Development -> Small, Frequent Release
- Full-time customer engagement with the team
- Collective owenership
- Change supported through regular system release
- Simplicity -> refactoring

### XP in practice
- Not widely used
- practices are widely used
  - User-stories
  - Refactoring
  - TFD
  - Pair Programming
  
### Agile Project Management
#### Scrum
1. Initial Phase
2. Sprint Cycles
3. Project Closure Phase
